🌱 Green Cure – Project Overview

Goal:
To create an intelligent decision-support platform that improves crop yield and soil health through data-driven insights.

What it does:

Collects soil, weather, and crop data from sensors, APIs, and user input.

Uses an AI reasoning model (Gemini + LangChain pipeline) to analyze conditions and suggest:

Best crops to plant for a given season and soil type

Early disease detection and treatment suggestions

Weather-based advisories for irrigation and harvesting

Presents everything in a Streamlit-based user interface that farmers or experts can easily use.

Outcome:
Green Cure bridges traditional agriculture with modern AI. It helps reduce risk, increase productivity, and promote sustainability by delivering real-time, explainable recommendations to farmers and policymakers
